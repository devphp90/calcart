<h3>
MyProfile</h3>
<p>
Set how your Cart will look in MyProfile.&nbsp; Your avatar/logo, name, address, 
etc.</p>
<p>
To link to your cart, add your provider ID to the string,
<a href="http://www.axeo.net/CalCart/">http://www.axeo.net/CalCart/</a>.<br>For 
example, <a href="http://www.axeo.net/CalCart/17">http://www.axeo.net/CalCart/17</a>.&nbsp; 
The provider ID=17.<br><br>Your ID is unique and is set by our system when you 
sign-up.&nbsp; The ID distinguishes and filters your records from other user's 
data.<br>The ID cannot be changed.<br><br>You could place this hyperlink in your 
website to link to your Cart, or just send the link in an email to your 
customers and prospects.<br>You could use CalCart stand-alone with or without 
your own web site.</p>
<p>
To turn-off your Cart completely, remove the link to your Cart from your web 
site, and/or make all services inactive.</p>
<h3>
Services</h3>
<p>
Your Services are like your inventory.<br>Create a Service record for each appointment slot or session
you have available for scheduling.<br><br>

Use the Service Name and Description field for all pertinent information needed to book that Service.
Who, what, when, where, etc.<br><br>

Once entered, go to the cart (the frontend) to see how your Services will look.
Make any necessary adjustments.  Note that any Services you create or any changes you make are live in the frontend immediately.<br>
<br>Use the Service Name and Description fields in a way that works for you. 
You can communicate as much or as little detail as needed.<br><br>Toggle the 
Active field on and off to make a Service visible in your Cart (the frontend).<br>
<br>Set the Capacity field for the max number of students for that service session.<br>For individual sessions, the Capacity will be 1.<br>
<br>Each time the 
Service is booked, the Qty Ordered field is incremented by 1 and compared to the 
Capacity.<br>When the session is full, the Service no longer displays in your 
Cart.<br><br>A Service remains visible in your Cart and available for scheduling online 
until you mark it as inactive, or the session is full (Capacity = Qty Ordered).<br><br>
</p>
<h3>
Orders</h3>
<p>
You can create an Order here in the backend, maybe you received an Order by phone, or you could just use the frontend yourself to submit an Order.

<br><br>
When your customers schedule online, an Order record is created in your database for you.<br>
Remember, when you take an order off-line, CalCart doesn't know, so be sure to 
login to CalCart Admin to quickly de-activate the session that was just booked 
or you run the risk (albeit, slim) that the session gets double booked.
<br><br>
An email confirmation is sent to you to the address in MyProfile, and to your customer to the address they entered at Checkout time.

<br><br></p>
<p>
Let's say you have a session with a capacity &gt;1.&nbsp; An event, or group lesson 
for example.<br>Your customer will need to place multiple orders if they want 
multiple seats.<br>Maybe the parents are ordering for more than one child at a 
time.</p>
<p>
CalCart Lite does not allow the Customer to cancel or modify an Order.&nbsp; 
They need to call you or email to do so.</p>
