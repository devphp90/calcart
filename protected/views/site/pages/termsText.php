AXEO may automatically update AXEO Products or Services you have installed on your computer without your prior consent.

If you fail or refuse to approve such fees, AXEO may, in its sole discretion, terminate your current license, continue to support your current AXEO Products or Services without the automatic update, or replace your AXEO Products or Services with other AXEO Products or Services. If AXEO terminates your current license on account of your failure or refusal to approve such fees, then AXEO will refund, on a pro-rata basis based on the remaining term of the current license, any fees related to the period during which you will not have access to your AXEO Products or Services. If AXEO updates the AXEO Products or Services without requiring an additional fee and you object to such change, your sole remedy shall be to terminate your use of the AXEO Products and Services.
